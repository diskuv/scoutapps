  ; This is the developer tools package. See the documentation for the CMake CACHE variable
  ; DKSDK_DEV_TOOLS.

  ; Future Compatibility when building outside of DkSDK
  ; ---
  ;
  ; The developer tools package should be installed in a different ocamlfind
  ; destination (different opam switch, etc.) than the other opam packages listed in this file.
  ; By following this recommendation you can have a different set of versions for the developer
  ; dependencies compared to the other packages.
  ; Let's walk through an example. All other opam packages listed in this file must -- if they
  ; have a `cmdliner` dependency -- share the same `cmdliner` version. Let's say that version is
  ; `cmdliner.1.1.1`. By using a distinct opam switch for the developer package, you are free to
  ; use `cmdliner.1.0.4` or any other version of cmdliner.
